              Hello! I'm Colby Acton, I grew up in a small town called Sackville, New Brunswick. I moved to pursue a degree in civil engineering at the University of New Brunswick, but I quickly realized that i did not enjoy this field and dropped out.
              <br /><br />
              I took time to work and gained valuable experience through various labor roles, including lawncare and trail construction for the city and UNB. This hands-on experience helped me develop a strong work ethic and a love for problem-solving.
              <br /><br />
              While working I realized my true passion lied in computers and thats when I joined the Programmer Analyst program at New Brunswick Community College (NBCC), where I'm learning the funementals of programming and problem solving.
